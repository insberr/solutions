# solutions
Solutions to all sorts of annoying problems. Ranges from common to rare. I canâ€™t seem to remember these solutions sometimes too..


## Fix npm requires root access to install modules
Use nvm. It's that simple.

## Create GitHub repo from command line in a folder and push it.
_Yeah I know, I dont know how to use git._  

If you get a permission denied error when trying to push to the repo, you may need to create a new ssh key and add it to your GitHub account.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 'your_email@example.com"
```
Copy the entire contents of the saved file (it should have listed it after you executed the command).  
Go to your GitHub Account Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > and create a new SSH key. Give it a name and set it to `Authentication` then paste the file contents into the ssh key feild.
