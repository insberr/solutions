# Solutions
Solutions to all sorts of annoying problems. Ranges from common to rare. I canâ€™t seem to remember these solutions sometimes too..

## Table of contents
Maybe ill organize this better later. Or even make it a website.


## Fix npm requires root access to install modules
Use nvm. It's that simple.  

Uninstall Nodejs and NPM  

Then install NVM - [NVM install and update instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)  

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

# or

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Then install node using NVM
```bash
nvm install node
```


## Create GitHub repo from command line in a folder and push it.
_Yeah I know, I dont know how to use git._  

If you get a permission denied error when trying to push to the repo, you may need to create a new ssh key and add it to your GitHub account.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 'your_email@example.com"
```
Copy the entire contents of the saved file (it should have listed it after you executed the command).  
Go to your GitHub Account Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > and create a new SSH key. Give it a name and set it to `Authentication` then paste the file contents into the ssh key feild.

```

git push -u origin master
```
